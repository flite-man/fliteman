                </p> <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p> <p>
                  For a better experience, while using our Service, I
                  may require you to provide us with certain personally
                  identifiable information, including but not limited to salary, investments, credit card information, savings. The information that

                  I want to inform you that whenever you
                  use my Service, in a case of an error in the app
                  I collect data and information (through third party
                  products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may
                  include information such as your device Internet Protocol
                  (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the
                  configuration of the app when utilizing my Service,
                  the time and date of your use of the Service, and other
                  statistics.
                </p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>
                  Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are

                  This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
                  the app may use third party code and libraries that use
                  “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.

                  I value your trust in providing us your

                  identifiable information from children under 13. In the case
                  I discover that a child under 13 has provided
                  me with personal information, I immediately
                  delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian

										<p>
	                  By downloading or using the app, these terms will
	                  automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
	                  that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not
	                  allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or
	                  our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to
	                  extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try
	                  to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative
	                  versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright,
	                  database rights and other intellectual property rights related
	                  to it, still belong to Chethan Kamath.
	                </p> <p>
	                  Chethan Kamath is committed to ensuring that the app is
	                  as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we
	                  reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for
	                  its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never
	                  charge you for the app or its services without making it very
	                  clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
	                </p> <p>
	                  The Fliteman app does not store and/or process personal data that
	                  you have provided in the Fliteman app. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and
	                  access to the app secure. It is therefore recommended that you do
	                  not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
	                  removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
	                  official operating system of your device. It could make your
	                  phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs,
	                  compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
	                  that the Fliteman app won’t work properly or at all.
	                </p> <!----> <p>
	                  You should be aware that there are certain things that
	                  Chethan Kamath will not take responsibility for. Certain
	                  functions of the app will require the app to have an active
	                  internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided
	                  by your mobile network provider, but Chethan Kamath
	                  cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full
	                  functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
	                  have any of your data allowance left.
	                </p> <p></p> <p>
	                  If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
	                  should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
	                  mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may
	                  be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for
	                  the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
	                  other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting
	                  responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
	                  charges if you use the app outside of your home territory
	                  (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If
	                  you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
	                  using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have
	                  received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
	                </p> <p>
	                  Along the same lines, Chethan Kamath cannot always take
	                  responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to
	                  make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of
	                  battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service,
	                  Chethan Kamath cannot accept responsibility.
	                </p> <p>
	                  With respect to Chethan Kamath’s responsibility for your
	                  use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to
	                  bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is
	                  updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties
	                  to provide information to us so that we can make it available
	                  to you. Chethan Kamath accepts no liability for any
	                  loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of
	                  relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
	                </p> <p>
	                  At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is
	                  currently available on iOS – the requirements for
	                  system(and for any additional systems we
	                  decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,
	                  and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
	                  using the app. Chethan Kamath does not promise that it
	                  will always update the app so that it is relevant to you
	                  and/or works with the iOS version that you have
	                  installed on your device. However, you promise to always
	                  accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
	                  also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of
	                  it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
	                  Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
	                  rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end;
	                  (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it
	                  from your device.
	                </p> <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p> <p>
